  ## How does it work
  the feature I worked on is the daily recommendations, this works as follows.
  Every day you will receive between 5 and 10 recommendations of people based on your preferences and goals. You can either skip or like these people.
  When you like a person, the app will save the profile on a list that you can find in the dumbell icon at the top left of your screen. 
  So you can make contact with this person later on.
